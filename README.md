## üéâ Welcome to the University Impact Hackathon! 

[University Impact](https://universityimpact.org) is dedicated to enhancing philanthropy and impact investing. At UI, one of our main missions is making charitable giving easier. We work with financial advisors to empower donors, which in turn provides successful nonprofit organizations with the resources they need to continue creating change.  We're launching this hackathon to bring together bright minds to solve pressing social and environmental problems through technology and innovation.

## üöÄ Hackathon Overview

The University Impact Hackathon is a virtual event designed to foster innovation and collaboration. Participants will work in teams to develop solutions that address real-world challenges in the nonprofit sector, such as improving public transportation, enhancing charity evaluation methods, and increasing fundraising effectiveness. This is an ongoing Hackathon with continuous seasons. Judging will take place after submission deadlines for each season, and prizes will be awarded. Each season will have its own specific bounties, but each within-season bounty will also contribute to our four overall goals (detailed below). 

## üéØ Overall Challenges

We've identified several key areas where technology can make significant social impact that we would like to explore.

1. **Charity Evaluation and Impact Measurement:** Develop tools to measure and evaluate the effectiveness of charities.
2. **Nonprofit Fundraising Solutions:** Create innovative solutions to increase fundraising capabilities for nonprofits.
3. **Donor Engagement and Transparency:** Build platforms to show donors the direct impact of their contributions.
4. **Support for Public Charities:** Enhance awareness and support for charities making a significant social impact.

For each season bounty, we provide a detailed brief, including the problem statement, resources, and potential ideas for solutions on our [challenges page](https://github.com/users/siko-ki/projects/1).
